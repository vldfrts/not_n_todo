# not_n_todo
This a Python written command line interface program dedicated to managing tasks effectively and efficiently. This is the much more complicated version of my CS50P Final Project (Task Manager) complete with core functionality of the base version but with additional reading, writing, and appending capability to a csvfile in order to store the tasks.
